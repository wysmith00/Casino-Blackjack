Project Choice : Casino-Blackjack

Project Description: My game choice is Blackjack. Blackjack is a strategy card game where you try your luck against the Dealer to win some credits and come out on top. Card number totals of the players hand will be shown the entirity of the game, while one of dealers cards will be shown, and second card revealed after the Players turn. Game results will show automatically at the end of the round, whenever a Blackjack is presented, or if the Player or Dealer "bust". 

MVP Goals: 
1) As a player, I want my game to deal  the cards appropriately with the score being shown for the Player at all times so there is never confusion regarding your score. Also the Dealers one card should be shown at all times. 
2) As a player, I want to be presented with the proper game choices. Buttons saying to "Hit" "Stay" or "Double Down"
3) As a player I want there to a be a click function for my chioces so I know they've been selected
4) As a player, I want there to be a play again option when all game choices are exhausted and the round is over
5) As a player I want the UI to be engaging like a casino, pleasant for the Player and wanting them to keep participating. 
6) As a player

Stretch Goals: 
1) An image for when the Player scores a BlackJack 
2) background sound/casino white noise to give the audience an immersive experience
3) The card deck should have a royal appearence, looking expensive
