Try your luck in the casino at the Blackjack table! Beat the dealer and have the high card or even hit a Blackjack. See if luck is on your side.

The object of the game is to be to closest to 21 while you compete against the dealers hand. If you hit blackjack (Ace + 10) you win! Both of the players cards will be flipped over, while only one of the dealers cards will be shown. If you go over 21, that is a bust and you lose the round and your money, If an Ace is played, that card represents both nummbers 11 and 1. The player then decides if they would like to hit (recieve an additional card) or stay (end their turn). If the Player does not bust (go over 21) the Dealer then reveals their additional card. If the Dealers cards add up to 16 or under, they then must hit and recieve an additional card. If the Dealers cards ever exceed 21 he immediately loses and the Player wins and recieves their money. If the Dealers cards ever equate to being between 17 and 21, you then compare hands to find the higher of the two hands. The higher of the two hands is the winner!


// Pseudocode //

1. Start the game by making your bet and then hitting the "Start/Draw" button 
2. Cards are dealt, revealing both of the "players" cards and only revealing one of the Dealers
3. If neither the Dealers or the Players cards equate to 21, the Player then has 3 options (Hit, Stay, Double-Down). The Player ends their turn by deciding to "Stay" or having cards equating to 21. Again, if Players cards ever go over 21, they lose, and the round is immediately over.
4. Dealers cards are then revealed. Dealer must then play their hand. If the dealers cards ever equate to a number between 17-21, their round is over. If they go over 21, the Dealer then busts and the round is over.
5. If both the Players and the Dealers cards are less than or equal to 21, they then compare hands to see who has the higher hand
6. The loser of the hand loses the round.
7. If you are dealt a Blackjack (Ace and 10) you automatically win
8. If both the Dealer and the Players hands equate to the same value, it is a Push (Tie game), and you neither win nor lose.
9. Player then decides if they would like to continue playing. Play again?
